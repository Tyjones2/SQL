Project Overview

This SQL project analyzes a comprehensive automotive dataset (from Turbo.az) to uncover key insights about pricing trends, fuel type distribution, and vehicle depreciation. The analysis consists of three core queries that form the foundation for a dynamic Tableau dashboard (currently in development).

Key Objectives:

Price Analysis by Brand: Identify high-value brands and their pricing ranges.
Fuel Type Market Share: Understand consumer preferences across different price segments.
Age vs. Price Correlation: Measure depreciation trends for top-selling brands.



-- 1. Price Analysis by Brand:
Objective: Determine the average, minimum, and maximum prices for car brands with at least 50 listings to ensure statistical significance.
Business Use Case: Helps dealerships benchmark pricing strategies and identify competitive positioning.

SELECT make, AVG(price) AS avg_price, MIN(price) AS min_price, MAX(price) AS max_price, COUNT(*) AS listing_count
FROM turbo
GROUP BY make
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 50
ORDER BY avg_price DESC;
--
2. Fuel Type Market Share by Price Segment
Objective: Analyze the percentage distribution of fuel types (gasoline, diesel, hybrid, etc.) across different price brackets.
Business Use Case: Assists in inventory planning by identifying which fuel types dominate specific price ranges.WITH segments AS (

SELECT CASE
WHEN price < 10000 THEN 'Under $10k'
WHEN price BETWEEN 10000 AND 19999 THEN '$10k-$20k'
WHEN price BETWEEN 20000 AND 29999 THEN '$20k-$30k'
WHEN price BETWEEN 30000 AND 39999 THEN '$30k-$40k'
WHEN price BETWEEN 40000 AND 49999 THEN '$40k-$50k'
ELSE '$50k+'
END AS price_segment, fuel_type
FROM turbo
)
SELECT 
price_segment, fuel_type, COUNT(*) AS count,
ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY price_segment), 2) AS percentage
FROM segments
GROUP BY price_segment, fuel_type
ORDER BY price_segment, count DESC;
--
--3. Age vs. Price Correlation (Depreciation Analysis):
Objective: Calculate how vehicle prices depreciate over time for the top 10 most listed brands.
Business Use Case: Helps used car dealers and buyers understand value retention trends.

WITH top_brands AS (
SELECT make
FROM turbo
GROUP BY make
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC  -- Brands with most listings
LIMIT 10
),
vehicle_ages AS (
SELECT 
make,
(CAST(strftime('%Y', 'now') AS INT) - year) AS age, price
FROM turbo
WHERE make IN (SELECT make FROM top_brands)
AND year IS NOT NULL
AND price IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT 
make, age, COUNT(*) AS vehicles_count,
AVG(price) AS avg_price, ROUND(AVG(price) AS rounded_avg
ROUND(AVG(price) / NULLIF(age, 0) AS avg_price_per_year 
FROM turbo
GROUP BY make, age
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
ORDER BY make, age;
